# Pulse

## Problem
Sky-high costs, long wait times, and endless bureaucracy sometimes make you feel like youâ€™re filing taxes instead of seeking care for your well-being in the healthcare system. Especially for underserved communities this makes healthcare inaccessible, resulting in untreated illnesses.

## Insights
What if we had access to a personal healthcare assistant at all times just one call away?

## Solution
Pulse, an AI healthcare agent, trained on past medical papers and healthcare articles help diagnose any issues, and offer immediate care recommendations. While handling the initial paperwork required to get your treatment started and sending it directly to your nearest hospital or clinic.
