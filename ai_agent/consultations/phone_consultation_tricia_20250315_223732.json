      "doctor": "Based on what you've told me, Hi Tricia, based on what you've shared, it sounds like you're experiencing both pain and headaches. Since these symptoms are a bit unclear from the description, I'd like to understand more:\n\n- Where exactly is the pain located?\n- How long have the headaches been occurring?\n- How severe are these symptoms on a scale of 1-10?\n\nGiven that you're 19 and don't have any prior medical conditions or medications, this could be due to several common causes like stress, dehydration, poor sleep, or muscle tension. However, to be on the safe side, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Making an appointment with your primary care doctor to get properly evaluated\n2. Keeping a symptom diary until your appointment (noting when pain/headaches occur and their severity)\n3. Ensuring you're staying hydrated and getting adequate rest\n\nIn the meantime, over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen might help manage your symptoms, but please get checked out by a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and get appropriate treatment.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",

Share what specific question or concern you'd like to discuss\n2. Clarify the pain location and type you're experiencing\n3. Rate your pain on a scale of 1-10\n4. Tell me how long you've had these symptoms\n\nThis will help me provide more accurate and helpful guidance for your situation. Is there anything else I can help with?",
